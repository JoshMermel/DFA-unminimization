\section{Proofs}
Any graph, \emph{G}, can be rewritten such that it has levels.  This is like a 
tree however there may be cycles.  More specifically, each vertex (or node) has
parents, children, and siblings.

\theoremstyle{definition}
\begin{mydef}
A \textbf{minimum planar-expansion} is the planar-expansion of a graph, G, using
the fewest number of duplications possible.
\end{mydef}

\begin{trees}
If some planar-expansion results in two independent trees with a common root 
vertex, then one of the trees is unnecessary for the planar expansion.\\
\textbf{Proof: }Suppose that the planar-expansion tree begins with the vertex 
$V_a$ and has children $V_{b_1}\ and\ V_{b_2}$. These children have the same
coloring (from the planar-expansion), because they are independent trees.  Since
they are independent, $V_a$ is satisfied by either $V_{b_1}\ or\ V_{b_2}$.  Thus
only one of the branches is required for the planar-expansion and the other is
unnecessary.$\qed$
\end{trees}

\begin{duplication}
Given some non-planar graph, G, if some vertex, $V_i$, must be duplicated to 
create a minimum planar-expansion, then all vertices must be duplicated.\\
\textbf{Proof: }For the sake of contradiction, assume not and that vertex $V_a$
is not duplicated to create a planar-expansion. $V_i$, however, was duplicated.
This must happen because \emph{G} is non-planar and so at least one vertex must
be duplicated. It follows then that there are a set of vertices, \emph{A}, that
can connect to $V_i$ but not to $V^{'}_{i}$. Consequently, there must also exist
a set, \emph{$A^{'}$}, that can connect to $V^{'}_{i}$. Since, \emph{A}$\neq$
\emph{$A^{'}$} (otherwise it would follow that $V_{i}=V^{'}_{i}$, and that 
\emph{G} is planar), there exists a set \emph{C}=
\end{duplication}
