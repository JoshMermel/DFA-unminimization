This is a coding project by Josh Mermelstein in the summer of 2012 for the
Tufts CS departament.  Its goal is to create a program that can take a
non-planar graph and determine if there is a way to make it planar by copying
any number of vertices while preserving connections.

The overall structure is centered on a circular doublely linked list which is
specified in the circ_list files.
